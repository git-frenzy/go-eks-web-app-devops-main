# Go Web Application

This is a simple website written in Golang. It uses the `net/http` package to serve HTTP requests.

## Running the server

To run the server, execute the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port 8080. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/courses` in your web browser.
